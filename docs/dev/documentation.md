# Building Documentation

## CLA

To contribute to the Binary Ninja documentation, first sign the [contribution license agreement] and send it to [Vector 35].

## Prerequisites

- [sphinx]
- [breathe] (note that on windows, breathe needs a small [fix])
- [mkdocs]
- [doxygen]


## Building

    git clone https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/
    cd binaryninja-api
    cd api
    mkdocs build
    echo User documentation available in site/
    cd api-docs
    make html
    echo API documentation available in build/html

## Changing
Changing documentation for the API itself is fairly straight forward. Use [doxygen style comment blocks](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html) in C++ and C, and [restructured text blocks](http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/docstring_python.html) for python for the source. The user documentation is located in the `api/docs/` folder and the API documentation is generated from the config in the `api/api-docs` folder.

!!! Tip "Tip"
    When updating user documentation, the `mkdocs serve` feature is particularly helpful.

# Snippet UI Plugin (v1.0 alpha)
Author: **Vector 35 Inc**
_Example UI plugin demonstrating how to create a snippet manager that allows for quick one-liners to be bound to hotkeys._
## Description:
This plugin is dual purpose -- first, it demonstrates the new UI plugin interface available for third-party plugins, and secondly it implements the often-requested functionality of adding a snippet editor. This is particularly useful for binding commonly used snippets of python code from the ScriptingConsole to a hotkey to be able to trigger them more easily.
